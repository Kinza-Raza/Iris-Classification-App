# iris-classification-app

A classification model trained on the 'iris' dataset available on UCI Machine Learning Repository to predict the class of the plant on the basis of dimensions of sepal and petal. This model was then transformed to a web app using the open source library called Streamlit. The web app was successfully deployed to Heroku.
